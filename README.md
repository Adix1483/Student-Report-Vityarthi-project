```

The application will display the main menu in the terminal.

## 5. How to Use the Project

After starting the program, the following menu will appear:

```text
STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYZER
----------------------------
1. Add Student
2. Add Marks
3. Add Attendance
4. Student Report
5. Display Students
6. Performance Analysis
7. Exit
```

Select an option by entering its corresponding number.

For example:

1. Select **Add Student** to register a student.
2. Select **Add Marks** to enter subject-wise marks.
3. Select **Add Attendance** to enter attendance details.
4. Select **Student Report** to view a student's complete performance.
5. Select **Performance Analysis** to view class-level statistics.
6. Select **Exit** to close the application.

## 6. Testing Instructions

The project can be tested manually through the console.

### Test 1: Add Student

Select:

```text
1. Add Student
```

Enter valid student information such as:

```text
Roll Number: 101
Name: Rahul
Branch: CSE
Semester: 2
```

**Expected Result:**

```text
Student added!
```

### Test 2: Duplicate Student

Try adding another student using the same roll number.

**Expected Result:**

```text
Student already exists!
```

### Test 3: Add Marks

Select:

```text
2. Add Marks
```

Enter a valid roll number and subject marks between 0 and 100.

**Expected Result:**

```text
Marks added!
```

### Test 4: Invalid Marks

Enter a mark outside the range of 0–100.

For example:

```text
Marks (0-100): 120
```

**Expected Result:**

```text
Marks must be between 0 and 100.
```

### Test 5: Add Attendance

Select:

```text
3. Add Attendance
```

Enter valid total and attended classes.

For example:

```text
Total classes: 40
Classes attended: 35
```

**Expected Result:**

```text
Attendance: 87.50%
```

### Test 6: Invalid Attendance

Enter attended classes greater than total classes.

For example:

```text
Total classes: 40
Classes attended: 45
```

**Expected Result:**

```text
Invalid attendance!
```

### Test 7: Generate Student Report

Select:

```text
4. Student Report
```

Enter an existing roll number.

**Expected Result:**

The program displays:

* Student name
* Roll number
* Branch
* Semester
* Subject-wise marks
* Total marks
* Average percentage
* Grade
* Attendance percentage
* Attendance status
* Best subject
* Weakest subject
* Overall performance

### Test 8: Performance Analysis

Add marks for multiple students and select:

```text
6. Performance Analysis
```

**Expected Result:**

The program displays:

* Highest-performing student
* Lowest-performing student
* Class average

### Test 9: Invalid Menu Choice

Enter an option that is not between 1 and 7.

For example:

```text
Enter choice: 9
```

**Expected Result:**

```text
Invalid choice, try again.
```

## 7. Expected Outcome

After successful execution and testing, the application should correctly store student information during the program session, calculate academic performance and attendance, generate student reports, and provide class-level performance analysis.

## 8. Project Limitations

* Data is stored only while the program is running.
* The application currently uses a console-based interface.
* No database is connected.
* Data is not automatically saved after the program is closed.

## 9. Future Enhancements

Future versions could include:

* Database integration.
* Permanent data storage.
* Graphical user interface.
* Student record editing and deletion.
* Exporting reports to PDF or Excel.
* User login and authentication.
* Graphical performance charts.
